<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<h3>Q1) JavaScript is a single threaded language. What does this mean?</h3>
<h4>JavaScript operates using a single thread of execution, which means that only one set of instructions is executed at a time. Unlike multi-threaded languages, where multiple threads can run concurrently, JavaScript executes code sequentially, one statement at a time.</h4>
